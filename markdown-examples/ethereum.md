# Ethereum

## Summary

Ethereum, currently the second biggest cryptocurrency in the world,  brought a "programmable blockchain" to the world. In a similar fashion to other cryptocurrencies, Ethereum allows users to create wallets, send money (in Eth) to other users, while avoiding double spending-issues and making the transactions secure and indisputable. Ethereum is a public blockchain, meaning that everyone can join the network, see transactions and validate them.
